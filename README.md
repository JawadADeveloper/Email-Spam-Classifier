# Email-Spam-Classifier
An Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning model designed to determine whether an incoming email is spam or not. It typically works by analyzing the content of the email, transforming the text into a numerical format (such as TF-IDF), and then using a classification algorithm like Naive Bayes to predict the likelihood of the email being spam.
